# Rain Meadow
## Get the mod on the Steam Workshop

![title banner](/Docs/banner.png)

## What is this

A true online multiplayer experience built on top of Rain World. Players join and play with no input delay and can go to different parts of the map without sharing a camera. It supports Arena, Story, and a custom game-mode called Meadow.

Do you know [Meadow from Might&Delight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/486310/Meadow/), the Shelter series guys? If you don't, maybe you should! This custom game-mode is a reinterpretation of that multiplayer experience, but in the Rain World universe.

## How does it work

Rain Meadow is a mod that can be loaded as just any mod. Each player launches their game and joins a lobby. Lobbies can be created with different game-modes selected, and the lobby owner can tweak settings for a lobby. Hot-join is supported.

Rain Meadow uses the Steam API for its online features and thus requires the game to be owned/launched on Steam.

## What is the current state of this project

We've reached the state where the mod is playable and enjoyable. There's still hiccups and bugs that will be fixed along the way. As a fan project, there isn't much of a roadmap or release schedule.

## Where can I find more

You can find playtesting builds and the full devlog over at [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ze3qaYq49j).

## How can I support this project?

Fuss about it, spread the word. You can also donate to the devs over at [my ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/henpemaz). If you're an experienced c# dev or you make rainworld mods, you can join the team to try and help with development!

## Why not fix Monkland

When I started this project, my initial thought was that I'm not experienced enough to fully understand and fix someone else's mod, by making my own I'll learn all I need to learn along the way. Also there was a massive update to the game, and they've update the Steamworks library that is used, it's the perfect time to start over.

This seems to be true since now I can fully understand the code for Monkland and all of its limitations.

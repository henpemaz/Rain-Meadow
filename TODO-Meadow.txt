raw

many crashes still

does self disconnecting detects?

going to fresh lobby still the most efficient

rot still stucks you (small creatures in GW drain entrance)

walljump helpiness tents to fling you on accidental wjs

whacamoles next to shortcuts are all over the place

so many unlocks are out-of-bounds

emote unlock has a lot of visibility, skin or creature don't

"wish I could TP to people, or TP them to me"

V wc tunnel times are too high
	too little feedback that you're stuck there

the jetfish still spawns

the vibezones music doesnt account for music off - recheck

V scav swing arm needs sync

scav stretched arm animates unintentionally?

echo + lightning palette (underhang) = flashing lights

creatures don't make shortcut-pip noises

scav hands "weight down" in zero g

vine-grab-sync is very problematic in the room before GSB (5p)

pebbles dialogue is default, and gravity keeps you trapped there

    what'd the meadow-lore be?

One laggy person can make things so problematic
    if there was a metric like "average ping to others" to chose leasers

I'm unhappy with the readme

emote wishlist:
    collision
    sleep

emotes display above map

people can still force/trigger rain in meadow?

hard to find people I played with

hard to see nametags on most gray-ish blue-ish colors

going down long poles as scav sucks

using 2+ emotes at once (same frame) breaks something about their duration

reds can't jump on false floors

waterfall pushdown on scavs is a bit much

scavs stuck in pole-near-ceiling in zerog, can only jump out up

HIGH-PRIO

crashes

bad ux

to sort:
esc on passage lobby
see foos thread


MEDIUM-PRIO

world
	world state of onlineplayer is a lot of rot etc because no filters apply

music
	joining group in vibezone overrides vibe

bugs
	saving in missing region stays in missing region - attempted fix

LOW-PRIO

Tutorialize
	emote usage
	emote wheel drag n drop
	changing skins and creatures

handholding
	would be so nice to grab cicada be carried by liz etc etc
	"it's of uttermost importance to me that one cannot troll others with this"
	either:
		- invite and accept-to-be-held; or
		- be grabbed by, with no consequences
			you are not heavier nor locked out of anything, no downsides
			Sky has both, with the invite system, but also the "follow"->"hold hand"

world
	hubs as trees
	accessibility pass on rooms

creature todo
- allow creature to change the creature-pipe they're going to mid-flight (very low prio)
- eggbug and lanternmouse are way too fast in zerog
- shortcutcolor for most creatures doesnt account for tint?

lizard todo
	could use proper lizard voice not default pink
	red liz gets wrong cosmetics with Remix on
	blues have trouble sticking to the ceiling (retest)
	blues have trouble climbing/pathing ledges (retest)
	lizard wallclimb is slow, slows you down a lot in zerog movemen

scav todo
	scav latching to pole with lots of momentum lets go? shelter room to drainage spot
	scav has trouble walljumping, doesn't count as walljumpable sometimes, hic02 lower spot (check?)

eggbugg todo
	regains footing mid-jump

following others around is hard
	could use pipes flashing colors if room inhabited
	player list on passage screen

accessibility
	squid had trouble in dsb06 underwater poles?
	ds a09, the crawlspace on left, creatures don't snap to crawling in it
	ds c03 exist is at water height wont path
	dsa13 corner up lizard stuck

emotes
	emotes go off-screen too often, need to show them in-screen near the creature when possible
	emote bg tint too strong, same for text

input
	throw is for switching pages on hotwheel, but also call, specially on controller
	rebindable keybinds for everything meadow
		- controller emote input
		- tab
	- people don't like locking in place while pointing
		// could combine with "look", after all just looking is kind of meh

music
	music plays maybe too often
		rethink triggers
		maybe options

customization
	could let one pick a tint "absolutely" limiting the range of the color-picker itself
		how do I do the same sanitization in the data though? I don't want hackers being fricks

	wolfy commented on a white-but-highly-customizable skin

menus
	redo scavenger selectscreen
	backing out of passage screen sends you to main menu

bugs
	map seems to reset progression if map png changes size?
